#+TITLE: Pad

We can save events with the format =duration since last event\nevent= and then read this and sonify it using Overtone. The event part can be a simple Overtone command that gets evaled.

Change background to reflect time of day. Or just show it in the title.

Perhaps self-isolated people shouldn't move and isolationP should be placeLocal.
