  imshow()

  Choose an image to display via a file dialog.

  imshow(img; axes=(1,2), name="ImageView") -> guidict
  imshow(img, clim; axes=(1,2), name="ImageView") -> guidict
  imshow(img, clim, zoomregion, slicedata, annotations; axes=(1,2), name="ImageView") -> guidict

  Display the image img in a new window titled with name, returning a
  dictionary guidict containing any Reactive signals or GtkReactive widgets.
  If the image is 3 or 4 dimensional, GUI controls will be added for slicing
  along "extra" axes. By default the two-dimensional slice containing axes 1
  and 2 are shown, but that can be changed by passing a different setting for
  axes.

  If the image is grayscale, by default contrast is set by a scaleminmax
  object whose end-points can be modified by right-clicking on the image. If
  clim == nothing, the image's own native contrast is used (clamp01nan). You
  may also pass a custom contrast function.

  Finally, you may specify GtkReactive.ZoomRegion and SliceData signals. See
  also roi, as well as any annotations that you wish to apply.

  imshow(canvas, imgsig::Signal) -> guidict
  imshow(canvas, imgsig::Signal, zr::Signal{ZoomRegion}) -> guidict
  imshow(frame::Frame, canvas, imgsig::Signal, zr::Signal{ZoomRegion}) -> guidict

  Display imgsig (a Signal of an image) in canvas, setting up panning and
  zooming. Optionally include a frame for preserving aspect ratio. imgsig must
  be two-dimensional (but can be a Signal-view of a higher-dimensional
  object).

  Example
  ≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

  using ImageView, TestImages, Gtk
  mri = testimage("mri");
  # Create a canvas `c`. There are other approaches, like stealing one from a previous call
  # to `imshow`, or using GtkReactive directly.
  guidict = imshow_gui((300, 300))
  c = guidict["canvas"];
  # To see anything you have to call `showall` on the window (once)
  Gtk.showall(guidict["window"])
  # Create the image Signal
  imgsig = Signal(mri[:,:,1]);
  # Show it
  imshow(c, imgsig)
  # Now anytime you want to update, just push! a new image
  push!(imgsig, mri[:,:,8])
